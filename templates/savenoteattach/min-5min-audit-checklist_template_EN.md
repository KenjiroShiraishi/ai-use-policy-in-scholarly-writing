- Manuscript version: v__  
- Manuscript date: YYYY-MM-DD

## 1. Scope of AI use (What this record covers)
- [ ] This record covers only AI assistance that materially affected **adopted text** in the manuscript  
- [ ] Exploratory trials / non-adopted outputs / full session logs are generally out of scope  
- [ ] The goal is not strict rerun-based reproducibility, but **practical auditability**  

---

## 2. Identify the adopted text (What was adopted)

### 2.1 Location adopted
- Section name:  
- Paragraph / topic (brief):  
- Summary of what was adopted (1–3 lines):  

### 2.2 Type of adoption (check all that apply)
- [ ] Concept clarification / organization  
- [ ] Framing or positioning of citations / prior work  
- [ ] Wording edits (incl. naturalization in English / compression)  
- [ ] Structural support (e.g., suggested logical ordering)  
- [ ] Examples / metaphors  
- [ ] Drafting a skeleton/outline (If adopted, state the reason and human review explicitly)

## 3. Prompt excerpt (minimal)
### Policy
- [ ] Full prompts do not need to be reproduced verbatim  
- [ ] If necessary, include only the **minimal excerpt** corresponding to adopted text in Appendix A  
- [ ] Do not include non-adopted outputs  

### Purpose (one line)
To preserve inspectability as a minimal, day-to-day audit record under an adopted-text-only approach.

## 4. Provider / Model / Date
- Provider (company/service):  
- Interface: Web / App / API (optional)  
- Tool / model name:  
- Mode / settings (optional):

## 5. Human oversight note (review and responsibility)
- Summary of human editing/revision (2–3 lines):  
- How facts/citations/argument were checked (1–2 lines):

## 7. Disclosure alignment
### Where AI use is disclosed in the manuscript
- [ ] AI Use statement  
- [ ] Acknowledgments  
- [ ] Methods / main text  
- [ ] Supplementary / Appendix  

### Self-assessment (assuming a three-tier schema like Resnik & Hosseini)
- [ ] Mandatory  
- [ ] Optional  
- [ ] Unnecessary  

- Rationale (one line):
