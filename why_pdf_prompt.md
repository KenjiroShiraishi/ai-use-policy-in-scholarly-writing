# Why Save AI Prompts as PDF?

To ensure transparency, reproducibility, and ethical integrity in scholarly writing that involves AI-assisted editing or drafting, it is essential to document and archive AI prompts. Saving prompts as PDF files provides the following benefits:

## 1. Transparency and Authorial Responsibility
Peer reviewers and editors may ask, *“How exactly was AI used in the manuscript?”* Providing the actual prompt is the most objective way to answer this. A general statement like "I used GPT" is insufficient—**the context and content of use matter.**

## 2. Tamper Resistance and Provenance Tracking
Unlike Markdown or `.txt` files, PDF files are less susceptible to unnoticed modification. Timestamped PDF records serve as **evidence of ethical authorship**, especially in clinical or ethically sensitive contexts where "who instructed what" must be clearly documented.

## 3. Support for Reproducibility
In open science, reproducibility is not just about data and code, but also the tools and prompts used during manuscript development. Treating AI prompts as **part of the research process** enhances future reanalysis, reuse, and transparency.

## 4. Alignment with Emerging Academic Norms
Leading journals such as NEJM AI and Nature are beginning to require disclosure of generative AI use. However, formal guidelines for saving or submitting prompts are not yet established.

We therefore propose that authors retain all prompts and AI outputs as PDF files, so they can be made available to editors or reviewers upon request, in the interest of transparency and accountability.
## 5. Trust Building
Skepticism toward AI-generated writing is increasing. Providing concrete records of prompts clarifies the boundaries between **human intellectual input and AI assistance**, thereby building trust with editors, readers, and co-authors.
