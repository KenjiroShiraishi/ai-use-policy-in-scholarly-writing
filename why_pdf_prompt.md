# Why Save AI Prompts as PDF?

To ensure transparency, reproducibility, and ethical integrity in scholarly writing involving AI-assisted editing or drafting, it is essential to document and archive AI prompts. Saving prompts as PDF files provides the following benefits:

---

## 1. Transparency and Authorial Responsibility

Peer reviewers and editors may ask, ‚ÄúHow exactly was AI used in the manuscript?‚Äù Providing the actual prompt is the most objective way to answer this. A general statement such as ‚ÄúI used GPT‚Äù is insufficient‚Äîboth the context and content of use matter.

---

## 2. Tamper Resistance and Provenance Tracking

Unlike Markdown or TXT files, PDF files are less susceptible to post hoc editing. Timestamped PDFs serve as durable evidence of responsible authorship, especially in clinical or ethically sensitive contexts where ‚Äúwho instructed what‚Äù must be clearly documented.

---

## 3. Support for Reproducibility

In open science, reproducibility extends beyond data and code to include the tools and prompts used during manuscript development. Treating AI prompts as part of the research workflow enhances reanalysis, reuse, and methodological transparency.

---

## 4. Alignment with Emerging Academic Norms

Leading journals such as *NEJM AI* and *Nature* have begun requiring authors to disclose AI use. However, formal guidelines for saving or submitting prompts are not yet standardized. Voluntary preservation anticipates and supports future policy shifts.

---

## 5. Trust Building

Skepticism toward AI-generated writing persists. By documenting and sharing prompt records, authors can clarify the boundary between human intellectual input and machine assistance‚Äîbuilding trust with editors, reviewers, readers, and co-authors.

---

## ‚úÖ Our Recommendation

We therefore recommend that authors retain all prompts and AI outputs as timestamped PDF files, ready to be submitted upon request, in the interest of transparency and accountability.
