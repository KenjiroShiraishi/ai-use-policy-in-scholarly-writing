# Transparent AI Use in Scholarly Writing

This repository provides practical templates and examples for transparent, ethical use of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) in academic writing.

## üì¶ We offer:
- A proposed policy for AI usage disclosure in manuscripts  
- Templates for AI prompt retention (PDF format)  
- Markdown-based disclosure examples in both English and Japanese  
- GitHub-friendly folder structures for reproducibility  

This project is part of a broader initiative to promote responsible AI use, reproducibility, and trust in scientific publishing.

üìù **We recommend** that all prompts and AI interactions used during manuscript preparation be saved as PDF files. These should be retained by the authors and made available to journal editors upon request, to ensure transparency and accountability in the writing process.

üìò If you're submitting to **NEJM AI**, **BMJ**, or **JAMA**, feel free to reuse and modify these templates.
